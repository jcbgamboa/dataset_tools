# Tools for the _Amazon Product Data_

The tools here are made to process the dataset available in
http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

(Notice that `run_create_vocabulary.sh` uses the `create_vocabulary.py`
from `../customer_review_dataset`.)

TODO: introduce other tools

Available tools:

* `analyse_amazon_reviews.py`: Counts the occurrences of certains words in the
	dataset. Useful for some initial exploratory statistics.
